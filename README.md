instructions:
use a new react-native project
create a folder called "firebase"
inside the firebase folder, add the firebase-config.js file thats here
edit App.js and use the code that's in the App.js thats here

then
npm install firebase

follow https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started, be very sure to follow all the steps
once you've done that also do "npm install @react-navigation/stack" , "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs", "@react-navigation/native-stack" in project folder

then follow the Android install instructions for https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation, do the gradle option, not manual
then do "npm install @rneui/base @rneui/themed"

that should be everything i think

---------------------------------------------------------------
Also when your on the page thats suppose to have the list of classes, doesn't load on first try, try saving the App.js file in Visual Studio and it should update
